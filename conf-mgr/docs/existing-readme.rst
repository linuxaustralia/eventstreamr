Conference Manager --- ReadMe
=============================

This project aims to reimplement the EventStreamr in Python.

This project currently has the following dependencies:

 -  Commands: :command:`ifdata` and :command:`hostname`
 -  Python 2.7.8
 -  PIP packages:
    -  Twisted (currently version 14.0.0)

This may also require PIP packages ``pyOpenSSL`` and
``service_identity`` if SSL is required. Otherwise it produces the
following warning:
``UserWarning: You do not have the service_identity module installed. Please install it...``

Running the files
-----------------

To run the manager, simply execute ``python -m manager``

To run the station, simply execute
``twistd --nodaemon --python station.py`` or for daemon mode:
``twistd --python station.py``. For more information on daemon mode and
``twistd``, see the `Twisted Documentation`_

Configuration Files
-------------------

.. warning::
    The configuration scheme is currently being changed which will likely invalidate most of the following.

manager.json
~~~~~~~~~~~~

station.json
~~~~~~~~~~~~

station\_config.json
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are laid out as mappings from a role to a uuid to the
configuration. as:

::

    //  <Role>      <UUID>         <Config Options>
    {
        "encode": {
                    "uuid - 1": {
                                    "timestamp": 100,
                                    "script": "hello_world.py"
                    },
        "upload": {
                    "uuid - 1": {
                                    "timestamp": 100,
                                    "script": "upload_to_youtube.py"
                    }
        }
    }

Manager/Station Communication
-----------------------------

.. note::
    This may change if we decide to move away from centuralised to a more dynamic network structure.

.. todo::
    Consider changing communication from a static manager to a more dynamic UDP or Broadcast -> Connect system.

The following assumes that the manager is currently running and that the
station is able to communicate with the manager.

1. The station connects to the manager.
2. The station sends it’s current configuration which includes IP(though
   not required), hostname, MAC address and currently configured
   roles(Using ``lib.general_commands.RegisterStationCommand``). This
   request isn’t responded to in any order.
3. The manager sends a(separate) request to the station with the up to
   date role config(may be the same as sent in step 2)(Using
   ``lib.config.UpdateConfiguration``).
4. The station responds to the request in step 3 to indicate if the
   configuration was successful. This is indicated by no exception being
   thrown. If the configuration is invalid then one of
   ``InvalidConfigurationException``, ``MissingRoleFactoryException`` or
   ``BlockedRoleException``\ (all from ``lib.exceptions``) is thrown
   with a descriptive error message. This message is enough to determine
   the problem without having to access the station’s logs.

Using this mechanism of the manager notifying the station of updates
will reduce polling for updates and disconnects the ‘Hello’ request from
updating the role’s configurations.
